## A Monument
“After I’m dead I’d rather have people ask why I have no monument than why I have one.”  
— Cato The Elder  
  
Many kings have ordered for statues to be built in honor of their victories, only to have them torn down after their lives have ended. Who benefits from the endless heralding of one’s own successes? __If one is truly great, others will proclaim their greatness for them.__  
  
Though you may see wealth and happiness in your life, focus on what you can continue to do rather than what you have done. It is wise to be proud of your achievements, but allow your reputation to speak of your magnificence instead of your words.  
  
Seekers of glory vanish the quickest. __Build a better life for those around you and they will build your monument.__
